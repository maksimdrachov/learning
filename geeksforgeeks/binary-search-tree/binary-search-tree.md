## Binary Search Tree: Search and Insertion

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary tree. There must be no duplicate nodes.

The above properties of Binary Search Tree provides an ordering among keys so that the operations like search, minimum and maximum can be done fast. If there is no ordering, then we may have to compare every key to search for a given key.

### Searching a key

For searching a value, if we had a sorted array we could have performed a binary search. Let's say we want to search a number in the array, in binary search, we first define the complete list as our search space, the number can exist only within the search space. Now we compare the number to be searched
